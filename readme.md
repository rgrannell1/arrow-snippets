Arrow-Snippets (v0.1)
===========================================

**Arrow-Snippets** is a Sublime Text 2/3 package containing snippets for
every function in the [**Arrow**](https://github.com/rgrannell1/arrow) functional programming
library for R. This package adds tab-autocompletion and method name suggestions for all **Arrow**
functions to Sublime Text, speeding up development significantly (at least for me).

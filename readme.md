Arrow-Snippets (v0.1)
===========================================



**Arrow-Snippets** serves a very specific purpose. It is a Sublime Text 2/3
package that adds text snippets for every function in the [**Arrow**](https://github.com/rgrannell1/arrow)
functional programming library for the R language. They can be handy for writing long
method chains quickly.
